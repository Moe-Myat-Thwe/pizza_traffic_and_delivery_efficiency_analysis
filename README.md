# 🍕 Pizza Traffic & Delivery Efficiency Analysis (Excel Dashboard)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes pizza delivery operations with a focus on **traffic patterns, delivery delays, and delivery efficiency**.  
The goal is to identify peak congestion periods, understand delay drivers, and evaluate how traffic and distance impact delivery performance.

A one-page interactive **Excel dashboard** was built to support operational decision-making for staffing, routing, and service optimization.

## 🎯 Business Questions
- When does pizza order traffic peak?
- How does traffic level affect delivery delays?
- Are peak hours more prone to delays?
- How does delivery efficiency change with traffic intensity and distance?
- Which pizza sizes and restaurants contribute most to delays?

---

## 📊 Key KPIs
- **Total Orders**
- **Average Delivery Duration (min)**
- **Delayed Orders (%)**
- **Average Delivery Efficiency (min/km)**
- **Orders During Peak Hours (%)**

---

## 📈 Dashboard Features
The Excel dashboard includes:

- Orders by Hour of Day (peak traffic analysis)
- Orders by Day of Week
- Delay Rate by Traffic Level
- Average Delivery Efficiency by Traffic Level
- Delay Rate by Pizza Size
- Average Delay: Peak vs Off-Peak
- Delivery Efficiency vs Distance (Scatter Plot with Trendline)
- Delay Rate by Restaurant

Interactive slicers:
- Restaurant Name
- Location
- Traffic Level
- Peak Hour
- Weekend
- Order Time (Monthly timeline)

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Orders peak between **6–9 PM**, driving most delivery delays
- **High traffic increases delay rate by ~4×** compared to low traffic
- Large and XL pizzas contribute disproportionately to delays
- Delivery efficiency declines as traffic intensity increases
- Distance impacts efficiency, but traffic has a stronger operational effect
